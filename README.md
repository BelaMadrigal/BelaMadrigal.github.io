My name is Isabela Madrigal (Bela for short) and I am in my third year 
pursuing an integrated degree in Computer Science Engineering and 
Communications at Lehigh University. I am currently in a Data Storytelling
class that will be creating several data visualizations that will be put 
in this repository.
